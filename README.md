# Projects

# Bushfire Brigade: A Life-Saving Educational Initiative with Bushfire Risk Prediction Model for improved preparedness (Python and Tableau)
A transformative educational initiative that empowers children aged 8-12 in Victoria, Australia with critical bushfire safety knowledge and skills. By integrating data analytics and machine learning, the platform not only educates but also enhances preparedness through interactive simulations, aiming to save lives and foster confidence in responding to bushfire emergencies. Interactive Digital Platform: Developed a dynamic platform with real-life bushfire stories, including 1983 Ash Wednesday fires, designed to captivate children and parents while teaching essential bushfire safety.

Machine Learning for Predictive Insights:
- Weather Data-Driven Analysis: Utilized 19 years of weather and bushfire data through QGIS to uncover key risk factors influencing bushfire outbreaks, such as temperature, wind speed, and humidity levels.
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) Model: Built a machine learning classification model to predict bushfire occurrences based on real-time weather data, providing accurate risk forecasts for proactive intervention.
- Interactive Risk Simulation: The SVM model allows students to adjust key weather parameters, such as temperature and wind speed, and immediately see how these changes affect bushfire risk, making the learning experience more engaging and data-driven.
- Potential for Future Alerts: While not yet implemented, the model can be used to generate real-time alerts on high-risk days in the future, helping students, families, and schools stay informed and take preventive actions ahead of bushfire threats.

Impactful Outcomes:
- Increased community awareness by providing data-backed insights into bushfire behavior and risk factors.
- Empowered students and educators with tools to actively engage in risk prediction and preparedness, improving response strategies and reducing the impact of bushfire emergencies.

# Bluethumb Art Market Insights - Web Scraping, Analysis and likelyhood of selling model (R Project)
A data analytics project using R and web scraping techniques to extract and analyze art market trends from the Bluethumb platform.

Key Insights:
- Emerging vs. Established Artists: New artists often struggle with visibility and sales. The art growth score model provides a data-driven approach to predict an artwork’s success based on pricing, size, style, and artist popularity, helping emerging artists navigate the market more effectively.
- Market Trends: Analysis of historical sales data reveals which art styles, subjects, and formats perform best. Contrary to common assumptions, cityscapes (10% conversion rate) significantly outperform landscapes (2.6%), suggesting a shift in buyer preferences.
- Buyer Preferences: Framed artworks consistently achieve higher conversion rates compared to unframed pieces, emphasizing the importance of presentation and framing choices in influencing buyer decisions.
- Text Analytics with Word Clouds: A word cloud visualization of successful artworks highlights recurring themes such as abstract, modern, vibrant, and textured, indicating the artistic elements that resonate most with buyers.

The Logistic Regression model developed for this project predicts the likelihood of an artwork selling based on key variables, achieving over 90% accuracy, 89% precision, and 58% recall. By leveraging these insights, artists and platform administrators can forecast sales potential, enabling artists to refine their strategies and align their work with market demand for greater success.

# Australian Tourism Insights: Interactive R Shiny Dashboard for Trend Analysis and Decision-Making (R Project)
The Australian Tourism Project utilizes R Shiny to create an interactive dashboard, providing a dynamic, data-driven analysis of tourism trends across Australia. The dashboard integrates multiple visualizations that allow users to explore various facets of tourism, offering clear, actionable insights for businesses, policymakers, and tourism operators.

Key features of the dashboard include:
- Visitation Trends: A time series graph shows the monthly visitor numbers over the past five years, allowing users to identify peak travel seasons. For instance, January sees a significant spike with over 1.5 million international visitors, while June experiences a drop to 900,000. This helps businesses forecast demand during different seasons.
- Demographics Breakdown: Interactive pie charts illustrate visitor demographics, showing that 45% of international tourists in 2023 were from Asia, with 30% from Europe, and 25% from North America. These insights enable targeted marketing strategies for specific regions.
- Regional Performance: A geospatial map highlights the most popular tourist regions, such as Sydney, Melbourne, and the Great Barrier Reef. For example, Sydney sees a yearly increase of 8% in tourist visits, whereas some regional areas like Tasmania show a 15% growth in the last 12 months. This allows local tourism authorities to focus on underperforming areas, stimulating investment and development.
- Visitor Spending Patterns: A bar chart visualizes how much different types of tourists spend on average, revealing that business travelers spend an average of $2,000 per trip, while backpackers average $500. This provides insight into the economic impact of different tourist segments.

The interactive nature of the dashboard allows users to filter by region, season, and tourist type to dive deeper into the data. The visualizations are designed to drive real-time decisions, enabling businesses to adjust their marketing and operational strategies based on up-to-date insights.

# Polar Ice Caps Melting - Infographic
Walking on Thin Ice is an infographic project that visualizes the critical state of our planet due to global warming and climate change. It explores the rising temperatures, the melting of polar ice, and the severe environmental consequences driven primarily by human activities.

Key Highlights
	•	Global Temperature Rise: An increase of +1.34°C from 1967 to 2017 due to greenhouse gas emissions.
	•	Polar Ice Melting: Rapid mass loss in Greenland and Antarctica, contributing to rising sea levels and loss of habitat.
	•	Impact on Wildlife: Projected declines in populations of polar bears and narwhals by 2050.
	•	Ocean Disruption: Melting glaciers threaten to disrupt the ocean conveyor belt, causing drastic global temperature shifts.
	•	Permafrost Threat: Potential release of 1400–1800 billion metric tonnes of CO₂ from thawing Arctic permafrost.
	•	Major Emission Contributors: Residential, commercial, industrial, waste, and forestry sectors.
	•	Call to Action: Emphasizes renewable energy use, reducing emissions, preventing deforestation, recycling, and spreading awareness.

	•	6.6 million internally displaced persons

Civilian Impact
	•	Causes of death: airstrikes, shelling, shootings, executions, and more.
	•	Age groups most affected: children and working-age adults.
	•	High-density refugee camps concentrated near the Turkish border.

Call to Action
This project also provides links to donation portals and urges action to support displaced Syrians.
