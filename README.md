# AnalyticsAlchemy
Data is more than just numbersâ€”it's a goldmine of untapped potential. AnalyticsAlchemy is my portfolio, where I turn raw data into actionable insights that drive business success, social impact, and innovation. AnalyticsAlchemy is my journey of transforming data into impact, one insight at a time. 

This collection showcases my diverse range of data-driven projects that span different domains such as environmental analysis, global conflict, art industry trends, and Australian tourism. Each project highlights my skills in data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling using various tools like Python, R, QGIS, and Tableau.

# Projects

# Bushfire Brigade - Life Saving Initiative (Python and Tableau)
This project is a digital platform aimed at educating children aged 8-12 in Victoria, Australia, on bushfire safety. With the increasing frequency of bushfires, children are highly vulnerable, and current educational methods often fail to engage them effectively. The Bushfire Brigade platform provides interactive, age-appropriate content, including real-life events like the 1983 Ash Wednesday fires, to build children's confidence in responding to bushfire emergencies.

The project integrates QGIS for analyzing bushfire data and weather conditions across a 19-year period. A machine learning classification model predicts the probability of bushfire occurrences using various weather parameters. Eight classification models were tested, and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) was selected due to its highest F1 Score of 0.6765 and Recall of 0.8214. This model provides accurate predictions of bushfire occurrences, helping communities better prepare for and respond to bushfires.

# Web Scraping Art Data from Bluethumb (R Project)
A data scraping project where I used R to collect and analyze art data from the Bluethumb platform. This project focuses on gathering valuable insights into artist performance, comparing their experience with growth metrics, and creating an "art growth score." The analysis provides predictions on an artist's progress on the platform based on various factors, offering actionable insights for both artists and platform administrators.

# Australian Tourism - R Shiny Dashboard (R Project)
This interactive R Shiny Dashboard allows users to explore Australian tourism data. The dashboard includes various metrics, visualizations, and interactive features that provide deep insights into the tourism industry, such as visitation trends, regional performance, and seasonality. It enables users to make data-driven decisions about tourism strategies and industry growth.

# Polar Ice Caps Melting - Infographic
An engaging and informative infographic designed using Canva, which illustrates the alarming trends in polar ice cap melting. The infographic breaks down key statistics and visualizes the impact of climate change on polar regions, providing a clear and concise look at the issue.

# Syrian War 2019 Snapshot - Infographic
This infographic provides a snapshot of the Syrian War in 2019, presenting key events, statistics, and insights into the conflict. It leverages data visualization to make complex historical and geopolitical events more accessible, highlighting significant impacts and humanitarian challenges.
